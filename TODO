- How do we address the auxiliary data mess? See 'auxiliary_data' argument
  in '?igblastn'.

- The user should be able to specify their own output file when calling
  igblastn(), maybe via a new explicit argument called 'out' (the output
  file is controlled via the -out argument of the igblastn executable).
  Note that:
    * The output file will always contain the raw output (i.e.
      unparsed output).
    * If 'show.command.only' then 'out' is ignored.

- Check support for Macaque.

- Figure out a way to automatically stamp AIRR germline dbs with a
  version number that allows to go back in time when needed.

- One should be able to pass the name of a IMGT germline db to
  install_IMGT_germline_db(), or a vector of names.

- Improve outfmt7-utils.Rd man page (e.g. document customized format 7
  and list_outfmt7_specifiers()) as well as associated unit tests (in
  tests/testthat/test-outfmt7-utils.R).

- Make 'num_threads' an explicit argument with default to 4. The doc should
  show how to specify a higher but still reasonable custom value based on
  detectCores().

- Parse $footer part of output format 7.

- Implement parsing of output formats 3 and 4?

- Set environment variable IGDATA to point to the internal_data directory.
  Note that IGDATA must be set to the **parent** directory of the internal_data
  directory.

- Add 'loci' argument to install_IMGT_germline_db(). Set to "IGH+IGK+IGL"
  by default but could also be any subset of the 3 loci e.g. "IGH" or
  "IGK+IGL" etc...

- Great resource for how to use AIRR Community Reference germline sets with
  IgBLAST: https://williamdlees.github.io/receptor_utils/_build/html/airrc_sets_with_igblast.html
  In particular, the author seems to be using an OGRDB REST API version 2:
    https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/api_v2
  but where is this API documented?
  All the download utilities implemented in igblastr/R/AIRR-utils.R use
  the OGRDB REST API at
    https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/api
  which is poorly documented and is somewhat confusing (see below).

- Investigate the following mysteries about the germline sets provided
  by OGRDB:

  1. The OGRDB API at https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/api/ allows downloading
     the germline sequences in 2 formats: ungapped or ungapped_ex.
     Which format is appropriate to use with IgBLAST?
     Note that downloading germline sets directly by clicking on
     the "FASTA Ungapped" links here
       https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/germline_sets/Homo%20sapiens
     or
       https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/germline_sets/Mus%20musculus
     seems to retrieve the "ungapped_ex" sequences for Human and the "ungapped"
     sequences for Mouse. Confusing!

  2. For some Mouse strains, OGRDB seems to provide germline sequences
     only for a limited number of loci/groups. For example for strain A/J,
     only sequences from the light chain (i.e. groups IGKV, IGKJ, IGLV,
     and IGLJ) seem to be available.
     See https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/germline_sets/Mus%20musculus

- Implement install_AIRR_germline_db(). Will download the germline sequences
  from https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/ (link provided by Kellie).

- Add vignette.

- Update README.md.
