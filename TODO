- Builtin C-region dbs for mouse and rabbit should be named
  _IMGT.mouse.IGH.202412 and _IMGT.rabbit.IGH.202412 to reflect the
  fact that they don't contain sequences from the IGK or IGL loci (light chain).

- Add 'loci' argument to install_IMGT_germline_db(). Set to "IGH+IGK+IGL"
  by default but could also be any subset of the 3 loci e.g. "IGH" or
  "IGK+IGL" etc...

- Investigate the following mysteries about the germline sets provided
  by OGRDB:

  1. The OGRDB API at https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/api/ allows downloading
     the germline sequences in 2 formats: ungapped or ungapped_ex.
     Which format is appropriate to use with IgBLAST?
     Note that downloading germline sets directly by clicking on
     the "FASTA Ungapped" links here
       https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/germline_sets/Homo%20sapiens
     or
       https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/germline_sets/Mus%20musculus
     seems to retrieve the "ungapped_ex" sequences for Human and the "ungapped"
     sequences for Mouse. Confusing!

  2. For some Mouse strains, OGRDB seems to provide germline sequences
     only for a limited number of loci/groups. For example for strain A/J,
     only sequences from the light chain (i.e. groups IGKV, IGKJ, IGLV,
     and IGLJ) seem to be available.
     See https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/germline_sets/Mus%20musculus

- Implement install_AIRR_germline_db(). Will download the germline sequences
  from https://ogrdb.airr-community.org/ (link provided by Kellie).

- Add unit tests.

- Add vignette.

- Update README.md.
